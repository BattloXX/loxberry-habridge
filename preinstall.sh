# <OK> This was ok!"
# <INFO> This is just for your information."
# <WARNING> This is a warning!"
# <ERROR> This is an error!"
# <FAIL> This is a fail!"

ARGV0=$0 # Zero argument is shell command

ARGV1=$1 # First argument is temp folder during install
echo "<INFO> Temporary folder is: $ARGV1"

ARGV2=$2 # Second argument is Plugin-Name for scipts etc.
